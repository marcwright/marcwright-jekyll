I've wanted to set-up Jekyll for a while to blog about my musical and development ramblings. I see a lot of similarities between the musical and development worlds.

Here is an article on [learning and failure][learning-and-failure]. It's a perfect metaphor for Fire Ready Aim.

It tells a story of a pottery class that was split into two groups. One group would be graded on the quantity of what they produced and the other group would be graded on the quantity. So, group #1 worked to make one pot as perfect as possible, while group #2 focused on creating several. 

The “moral” of the story is that the group that created 10 pots ended up making better ones than the group that focused on one. The quantity group learned from their mistakes and became better craftsmen.

As a songwriter, I can relate to over-thinking. I’ve often spent too much time attempting to craft the perfect song instead of crafting ten and learning from my mistakes. I’m definitely a perfectionist (most of us are), sometimes against my own best interest. I will try to be ok with failure.
