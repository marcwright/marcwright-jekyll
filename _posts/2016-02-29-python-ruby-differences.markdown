I'm taking a Data Science course that incorporates Python. I thought I'd write a quick summary of some key (cool) differences between the two similar languages.

#### Methods
Python and Ruby both use the method declaration `def`, but Python also uses `():` at the end of the declaration. Python does not need the `end` keyword to signify the end of a method block.
